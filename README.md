# NY-Mets-Practice-Website

I have been teaching myself HTML and CSS so, I created this website to practice my skills. I am a huge Mets fan so I decided to base my website off of them. The website itself is comprised of a homepage which then has links to bring you to other pages on the website. Each page is different in its own way. They all provide different information. I tried to incorporate as many skills and techniques that I have learned into this practice website.
