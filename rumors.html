		<h1> Recent Rumors </h1>

		<div class="rumor1">
			<p> Where will Yoenis Cespedes end up this offseason? </p>
			<div class="rumor">
				<p> Obviously the Mets really want to keep their star
				outfielder, but as you already know, Cespedes opted out
				of his contract. The Mets have offered him a qualifying 
				offer, but its not likely that he will accept. Instead, 
				he intends to try out the free agent market and see if 
				he can land a four or five year deal. I still wouldn't 
				count the Mets out because they could possibly construct
				 a similar deal as they did last year. Giving him the years 
				he wants but less money, and an opt out clause after a 
				year or so. Its going to be interesting to see what 
				Sandy Alderson can do with regards to Cespedes.</p>

		<div class="rumor2">
			<p> Relievers? </p>
			<div class="rumor">
				<p> With a good number of relievers trying their luck on 
				the free agent market, the Mets will be looking to restock 
				their bullpen in preperation for the new season. We do have 
				some solid pieces left, but we need to find the missing links. 
				The Mets will probably be looking for a lefty specialist, and a 
				couple of hard throwing right hand relievers. If they can fill 
				those spots, they should be good with pitchers.</p>

		<div class="rumor3">
			<p> Position Players? </p>
			<div class="rumor">
				<p> With a good number of players not being brought back, the 
				Mets will need to plug some holes in the field. Even if 
				Cespedes does not resign, we still have an abundance of outfielders. 
				The problem is going to be more in the infield. I would say that 
				the Mets would be looking at potential replacement at first base
				and the catcher position. There is a possibility that the Mets talk 
				with outfielders, but since Bruce's option was picked up, the most 
				work should be done on the infield. </p>

		<div class="rumor4">
			<p> What will Alderson be looking for in the offseason? </p>
			<div class="rumor">
				<p> From what we can tell, the Mets will be looking at a variety 
				of different pieces to help plug some holes. Relievers, first basemen,
				outfielder, and catcher, are all positions that the general manager will 
				be taking a look at during this offseason. We will share more news on which 
				players the Mets are looking at when negotiations begin. </p>
