			<p> Is Yoenis Cespedes going to stay with the Mets? </p>
			<div class="news">
				<p> Many reports indicate that after the World Series
				is over, Cespedes will opt out of his contract with the 
				Mets and look for a new deal. Sources are being told that 
				Cespedes is looking for a 3 or 4 year deal, and is looking 
				for a lot of money. Unfortunately the Mets will most likely
				not have the money to spend on Yoenis Cespedes. </p>
				<p> So what does this mean for their team now? Are they
				capable of repeating success without Cespedes' bat in their
				lineup? I guess those are all questions that we will find out 
				during the offseason.</p>

			<p> Will the starting rotation be healthy next year? </p>
			<div class="news">
				<p> Last season the starting pitching was a mess. No one 
				could stay healthy. First Harvey went down, then Wheeler 
				never came up, and then deGrom and Matz went down towards
				the end of the season. The only ones left were Syndergaard 
				and Colon. Yes, they did get some help from guys like Gsellman
				and Lugo, but they cant be counted on for this much work just
				yet. Hopefully this season our starting rotation can come back
				healthy. Good starting pitching goes a long way. If we have it,
				I say we have a good shot at making the playoffs for a third
				year in a row.</p>

		<div class="news3">
			<p> Can David Wright stay healthy? </p>
			<div class="news">
				<p> Over the last two seasons, David Wright has not played more
				than 60 games. Obviously he had some serious injuries to deal
				with, however, how will this effect us going forward. Will he
				still be able to produce at a major league level? Can he play 
				third base, or is it time to move him to another position? If
				he gets hurt again, is it time for him to retire? These are 
				all questions that will hopefully be answered by the time spring
				training rolls around.</p>

			<p> What is happening with Terry Collins </p>
			<div class="news">
				<p> As of right now, Terry Collins is one of the oldest managers
				in the MLB. During the first few seasons that he was with the 
				Mets, the team didn't do much, as they were still in the rebuilding
				phase. However, the last two seasons under Collins have been great.
				Making it to the playoffs twice, and almost winning the World
				Series in 2015, will probably be the highlights of Terry Collins'
				managerial carrer. There are reports coming out stating that COllins
				is done after the 2017 season. Do you think the Mets have it in
				them to bring home a championship under Collins?
